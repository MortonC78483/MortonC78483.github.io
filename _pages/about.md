I am a pre-doctoral research fellow at the [Stanford RegLab](https://reglab.stanford.edu/). I hold a B.S. in Mathematical and Computational Science with a minor in Environmental Justice from Stanford University with honors and distinction (2024). I am passionate about blending statistics with community-based research to drive policy change. As an undergraduate, I conducted research on the demographics of people living near oil wells in California, links between soil quality and human health, optimal locations for climate resilience hubs, and tools to classify disadvantaged communities. I am currently applying to PhD programs in Statistics and Biostatistics, and I am seeking to connect to potential advisors and fellow early-career statisticians.
